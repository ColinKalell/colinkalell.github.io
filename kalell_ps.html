 <h1> Personal Statement: Colin Kalell </h1>

<h2><b> My Background </b> </h2> 
<p> Hi, my name is Colin Kalell. I am from Dedham and this is my third semester at Boston College. 
I have no previous experience in web development or IT but I am excited to learn more about both 
those topics this semester. </p>

<h2> <b> My Interest in Web Development </b> </h2>
<p>I do not have any plans in web development but maybe this class will spark an interest.</p>

<h2><b> My Extra Curricular Interests </b> </h2>
<p> I enjoy watching all sports but my passion is golf. I try to get out on the course as much as
I can. My second favorite sport is hockey. I enjoy watching and going to Bruins games. it is 
a great spectator sport. </p>

<h2><b> What I hope to Gain From This Course </b> </h2>
Besides the 4 credits.. I hope to gain an A. All kidding aside I hope to gain a better understanding 
of web development and IT. 

<h2> <b>Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About </b> </h2>
I would love to touch on internet security a little this semester.
